---

UzonMail supports multiple platforms:

1. Windows 10+
2. Windows 7
3. Windows Server
4. Linux
5. Docker
6. macOS
7. Mobile

## Requirements

The core dependency is [.NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0).

Additional platform-specific dependencies may be required; refer to the corresponding installation pages.

The easiest method is to use the [Docker installation](https://mail.uzoncloud.com/guide/installation/docker), which simplifies installation, configuration and upgrades. Docker works on Windows 11, Linux and macOS.

## Downloads

Download specific releases from [Versions](/versions).

Since releases may be in active development, it is recommended to keep up to date with the latest patch in a minor version (for example choose the highest `x` in `v0.15.x`).
