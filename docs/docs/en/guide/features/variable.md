## Purpose

Using variables allows each email to be different. In customer acquisition scenarios, variables help make email characteristics less uniform, which can help avoid spam detection. In notification scenarios, variables enable personalized content for different users.

## Variable Types

UzonMail supports two types of variables:

1. Fixed-value variables
2. Random-value variables

## Fixed-value variables

These are variables that are replaced with specified values from your data source.

## Random-value variables

Random variables generate values at send time according to configured rules (for example random strings, numbers, dates, etc.), enabling variability across sent emails.
